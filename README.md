# BIOSIGNALS: General BVP, GSR, TMP and ACC experimentation in real-time, an open source software for physiological real-time experimental designs

1. Real-time acquisition and visualisation of physiological signals: blood volume pressure(BVP), galvanic skin response(GSR), temperature(TMP) and accelerometers(ACC).
2. Trigger synchronisation by a tcp/ip interface which allows start/stop recordings
remotely.
3. Data recording on EDF file format for electrophysiological signals.
4. Online behaviour labelling interface which labels are synchronised and stored on
EDF files.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Install requirements: pip install requirements.txt
2) In the folder ./GENERAL/constants_02.py tcp/ip ADDRESS must be set: '10.1.25.82' (your IP)
3) Run BCI_STANDARD_EXPERIMENT_03.py
