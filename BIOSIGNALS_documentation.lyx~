\begin_layout Section
Hardware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following device has been used for the BIOSIGNALS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Empatica E4 wristband by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) spin-off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Empatica E4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The E4 is a medical-grade wearable device that offers real-time physiological
 data acquisition.
 It measures blood volume pulse, from which heart rate variability can be
 derived, captures motion-based activity with a three-axis accelerometer,
 measures the constantly fluctuating changes in certain electrical properties
 of the skin (GSR), and reads peripheral skin temperature.
 It allows the synchronization of such signals by the use of an internal
 clock.
 The GSR and temperature sensors have a sampling rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $4Hz$
\end_inset

 while the accelerometers and the BVP signal are measured at 
\begin_inset Formula $64Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The combination of the GSR and BVP sensors enables to simultaneously measure
 the balance of sympathetic nervous system activity and heart rate.

\begin_layout Section
Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the code has been developed with pure python libraries in an object-oriented
 paradigm.
 The software engineering process was carried out taking into account cohesion
 and coupling for proper modularization.
 This allows the applications to be modular, scalable, and easy to maintain;
 in fact, this is a key aspect of any scientific tool to allow researchers
 to make modifications and to fulfill the specific requirements of each
 experimental scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The philosophy of BIOSIGNALS application is based on a supervised machine
 learning approach and therefore it offers two modes of interaction: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first allows for real-time acquisition and processing to generate a
 database and build models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The second provides online signal processing using pre-trained models to
 classify physiological patterns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed application is versatile and easily adaptable to different
 experimental designs while maintaining high-performance real-time signal
 processing.
 Aware that pattern recognition is in constant development, BIOSIGNALS applicati
on offers the option of importing python external scripts, which must have
 a predefined structure, to include self-developed machine learning methodologie
s.
 Besides, as experimental designs require event synchronization, a TCP/IP
 interface has been provided.
 BIOSIGNALS application is expected to be accessible to the entire scientific
 community, providing a resourceful tool for experimental paradigms of human
 behavior, which encompasses the following functionalities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Real-time acquisition and visualization of physiological signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Trigger synchronization by a TCP/IP interface that allows start/stop the
 recordings remotely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Recording of data on European Data Format (EDF) for physiological signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Online behavior labeling interface whose labels are synchronized and stored
 in the EDF files.

\begin_layout Itemize
APP: This class serves as the main software module that builds the application.
 It has been designed using PyQt5, a Python binding of the cross-platform
 graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit Qt, implemented as a Python plug-in.
 It launches all the other modules and forks several processes.
 First, the APP main fork.
 Second, a Driver is forked for each device, using the multiprocessing python
 library.
 Finally, it forks a thread for each Data Manager, using the multithreading
 python library.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Constants: Sets the whole constants used along with the application.
 Thus facilitating the specification of such general variables in a unique
 module.
 All adjustable parameters are set in this object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Queue: This Queue follows the FIFO rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ring Buffer: Stores the last values for each sampled source of information.
 The fixed size is defined by default in the Constants but it can also be
 dynamically modified during the GUI interaction through the 'Window size'
 Spin Box.
 Each time the fixed size is modified, the Ring Buffer is emptied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Driver: Meets the requirements of the real-time acquisition.
 It inherits from multiprocessing python library.
 It offers the interface between the APP and the hardware.
 Inter-process communication is facilitated by Queue.
 Once the fork starts running, iterates acquiring samples that are indefinitely
 queued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Data Manager: It is defined as an interface between the GUI and the Driver
 to properly separate the management of the acquired data.
 It inherits from a multithreading python library.
 It has access to the shared Queue so its role consist on extracting iteratively
 samples from the queue to insert them on a Ring Buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GUI Manager: Offers the management of each of the components of the GUI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GUI.ui: Implements the APP graphics.
 It has been designed using QtDesigner, the Qt tool for designing and building
 GUIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Trigger Server: A TCP/IP server for event synchronization.
 It can receive client connections and handles each request by notifying
 the Slots Manager using a callback function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Slots Manager: The purpose of this module is to bring the application to
 the versatility of adding a set of callbacks that allow synchronizing the
 overall logic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Online Filtering: This module has been implemented as an interface for a
 set of real-time signal processing methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Modules Loader: The main purpose of this module is to expand the versatility
 of the APP for a wide range of research scenarios.
 It is required that users code the scripts with a predefined structure
 as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:Imported-python-scripts"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The module will receive a reference to the APP instance so total access
 to the underlying object instances is offered.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Main workflow scheme:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once BIOSIGNALS app is launched it can work as follows; Data Manager is
 threaded and starts iteratively trying to extract values from the queue.
 The thread runs a loop that is controlled by a logical condition.
 The iteration process cannot acquire data if the queue is empty.
 Then, the Driver is forked and automatically detects the corresponding
 device to connect with.
 Following, the driver starts iteratively stacking data into the Queue from
 the hardware.
 Both the thread and the fork form a consumer-producer system.
 The Ring Buffer acts as a short term memory.
 The Data Manager fills the Ring Buffer each time a new value is obtained
 from the Queue.
 Once the Ring Buffer is full, it starts overwriting the oldest data and
 so on.
 At this point, two stages are provided:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stage 1: Real-time visualization can be performed by pushing the start button.
 It does not imply user data storage.
 The start button has been designed to test the quality of the signal acquisitio
n.
 The start button state will be changed, so pushing it again will stop visualiza
tion.
 Parameter settings (user filename, filter order, window size, online artifact
 removal method, and so on) should be done on this stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stage 2: Once the signals are properly acquired, the Trigger button can
 be pushed that initializes a TCP/IP server.
 The application only stores data in between a pair of client received requests.
 It is expected that one request indicates the start instant for event synchroni
zation while the second, the stop instant.
 For the following, two pairs of events form a trial.
 During the trial duration, the Ring Buffer slots a callback to the Data
 Manager whenever an amount of data equal to the window size is fulfilled,
 that is, a sample is generated.
 At the end of the event, the Data Manager permanently stores acquired samples
 in the users' file with its corresponding metadata.
 Data Manager counts the number of samples generated and the number of trials,
 other metadata values are obtained from the Constants module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Versatile workflow scheme
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modules Loader allows the definition of own produced scripts.
 Each imported script must follow a predefined structure.
 The versatility comes due to the reference given to the imported script
 to the main object instance.
 Thus, different scenarios could be provided through this component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Offline scenario: The user could experiment with the main workflow scheme.
 After collecting the required data, a script could be loaded containing
 the coding for an offline analysis, i.e., training a machine learning model
 and store it on disk for future use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Online scenario: The user, could perform online computation thanks to the
 reference given, having access to all the underlying object instances.
 Access to the Data Manager to acquire EEG samples online is therefore provided.
 Moreover, applying OAR methods or even using pre-trained machine-learning
 models for online predictions can be also easily implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main highlights of the application consist of its versatility: First,
 modularizing the interaction between the GUI manager and the Driver, which
 allows the embedding of drivers for other acquisition systems.
 Second, the separation between the GUI and the logic, where the former
 allows future modifications and performance of the GUI components, without
 altering the logic, and vice-versa; Finally, the Modules Loader, further
 expands the versatility, by offering the flexibility of incorporating self-deve
loped scripts for specific scenarios and workflow schemes.
 The proposed application IS versatile and easily adaptable to different
 experimental scenarios while maintaining high-performance signal processing
 in real-time.
